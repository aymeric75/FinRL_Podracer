call save_training_curve_jpg

	
which call draw_learning_curve (self.recorder)

	
	self.recorder holds for X (Evaluation) steps (the first value is of shape (1, 7), the 2nd will be (2, 7) etc.):

			7 values:

				steps: 512

				avg rewards

		
	self.recorder is updated once WHEN evaluate_and_save(actor, steps, exp_r) is called


			with "steps" taking the value of self.total_step

					with self.total_step updated by "steps" 



	
	=======> 
			
		evaluate_and_save is called ANY TIME Evaluator received data from Learner

						(it receives horizon_len * num_workers steps)


			BUT REALLY 'evaluates' (ie print Something on the graph)


				AFTER the "total_step" HAS REACH  "recorder_step"

				AND (for the next "turns") AFTER the "total_step" is "every" eval_per_step 


			WHEN TEST PASSED

				get_cumulative_rewards_and_step

					=====> THIS RESET THE ENV AND COMPUTE AVERAGE CUM REWARD 

						OVER MAX_STEP eval_times TIMES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


						(THE RESET STEP, "GOES BACK" to the begining of the 

							price_ary, IE put self.day to 0 !!!)
